Notes:

Snowball can be found in the dependency lib/lucene-snowball-2.2.0-cleartk-modified.jar.  This jar file was created from locally compiled code that was modified as described below.  The source code for Snowball is distributed with Lucene and is available from http://lucene.apache.org and can be found under the snowball directory of the contrib folder.  We obtained the version of Snowball provided with Lucene version 2.2.0.  It is not clear from the Lucene distribution what version of Snowball this would be.  


The class net.sf.snowball.SnowballProgram was modified in two ways:

1) the class was made abstract
2) the abstract method stem() was added

Otherwise the entire library is exactly the same as what is distributed with
lucene 2.2.0.

Lucene is provided under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  The Lucene distribution of Snowball makes modest changes to the code
