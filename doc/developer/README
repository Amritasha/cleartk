
- releasing software
- committing changes to subversion
	- code should compile
	- should always have a commit message
		- should refer to an issue
		- or should be a self-contained description of the change
	- should not break unit tests unless a test was created to demonstrate a bug reported in an issue (e.g. test for 98) 
- IP issues
	- no code should ever be copied into the ClearTK codebase unless:
		1) the source of the code is properly credited.  
		2) it is in compliance with the license it is provided with.  Usually this means two things - that the license
		   is compatible, proper credit is given, and the copyright and license are redistributed with the copied code.
