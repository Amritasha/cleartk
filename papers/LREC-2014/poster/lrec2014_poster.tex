    \begin{block}{Overview}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item ClearTK makes statistical machine learning within the UIMA framework more manageable by providing:

        \begin{itemize}
        \item A common interface and wrappers for ML libraries such as: SVMlight, LIBSVM, LIBLINEAR, OpenNLP MaxEnt and Mallet
        \item A rich feature extraction library
        \item Infrastructure for using and evaluating ML classifiers
        \item A variety of wrappers for existing NLP libraries (Stanford, CLEAR Parser, etc\ldots)
        \end{itemize}

      \item Today we reflect on 5 years of code-base evolution to:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item recommend best practices for making NLP frameworks better suited to development of components that rely on machine learning 
        \item share design patterns for making NLP frameworks more robust to diverse uses
        \item discuss lessons learned in making NLP frameworks more accessible to the programmer
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Annotators should be conceptually simple}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Previous versions of ClearTK obfuscated away well understood UIMA conventions.
      \item The improved \code{ClassifierAnnotator} interface encourages annotator developers to:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item put feature extraction code in the well understood \code{process} method.
        \item make explicit annotator functionality in both training and classification modes.
        \end{itemize}
      \item We made the BIO chunking APIs more accessible by:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item inheriting from the already-known \code{ClassifierAnnotator}
        \item eliminating specialized interfaces
        \item providing simple utility objects for converting between chunk labels and token labels
        \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}

    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Pipelines should look like pipelines}
      \item Early ClearTK evaluation infrastructure consisted of a myriad of loosely-coupled classes and methods
      \item Improved evaluation APIs have only three methods: Read, Train, and Test.
      \item \code{TrainableFeatureExtractors} take advantage of the ClearTK users' familiarity with the notions of training and classifying by providing \code{train} and \code{transform} functionality
