Notes: 

Mallet was built from source using the 2.0-RC4 source release.  

The following changes were made:

cc.mallet.pipe.Csv2FeatureVector.java 
The line (about 65) with the following text was removed:

java.util.Arrays.sort(keyIndices); 

removed cc.mallet.fst.LabelDistributionEvaluator -  
removed cc.mallet.util.resources.wn.Examples - removes need for jwnl-1.3.jar

The only remaining dependencies for Mallet are given in the pom file.  
 
Here is how I determined the dependencies.  First I created a Java project in Eclipse 
with the contents of the downloadable mallet-2.0-RC4.tar.gz using the Eclipse new project 
wizard called "Java Project from Existing Ant Buildfile".  This created a project that compiles but 
has all of the jar files in the lib directory on the classpath.  I removed all of the jar files not listed
in lib/Makefile.  I then removed additional jar files that I didn't think would be needed.  These were:
jwnl-1.3.jar
openjgraph.jar
secondstring-serializable.jar
xml-apis.jar 
xmlParserAPIs.jar 

I then made the changes detailed above to the source code.  Next, I rebuilt mallet-deps.jar using lib/Makefile after
making the obvious edits to the Makefile.  I then rebuilt mallet.jar using the Makefile in the top-level directory.  I put
the rebuilt mallet.jar and mallet-deps.jar into ClearTK-framework/lib directory and added them to the classpath by adding
the following snippet of xml to the pom file:

		<dependency>
			<groupId>mallet</groupId>
			<artifactId>mallet</artifactId>
			<version>2.0-RC4</version>
			<type>jar</type>
			<optional>false</optional>
			<scope>system</scope>
			<systemPath>${basedir}/lib/mallet.jar</systemPath>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>mallet</groupId>
			<artifactId>mallet-deps</artifactId>
			<version>2.0-RC4</version>
			<type>jar</type>
			<optional>false</optional>
			<scope>system</scope>
			<systemPath>${basedir}/lib/mallet-deps.jar</systemPath>
		</dependency>

I then made sure a clean compile of both ClearTK-framework and ClearTK-toolkit was performed and then I ran all the unit tests.  
I then felt confident I had all of the dependencies accounted for and created the pom file found here.
