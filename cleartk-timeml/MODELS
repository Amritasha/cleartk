Model licensing issues
======================
The models in ClearTK-TimeML were trained on the TempEval 2013 data:

http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task1/index.php?id=data

The models do not contain the full original data, but they do contain features
and model information derived from this data. You should verify that it is
acceptable to your project to use models derived from such data (e.g. by
reading any license associated with the TempEval 2013 data and/or by consulting
a lawyer.) 
 

Training the TempEval 2013 models
=================================
The process for training models from the TempEval 2013 data is as follows:

1. Download the TempEval 2013 training data from
   http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task1/index.php?id=data
   under the "TBAQ-cleaned (NEW VERSION no self-relations)" link.

2. Extract the `TimeBank` directory from the training data archive.

3. Run `org.cleartk.timeml.eval.TempEval2013Evaluation`. You will need to
   specify enough memory (e.g. `-mx1g` in your Java VM arguments) and the
   following program arguments:

       --train-dirs /path/to/TimeBank
       --verb-clause-tlinks
       --train-only

   This will generate all the necessary ClearTK-TimeML models in the
   appropriate directories under `src/main/resources`.

Note that the above settings are those that performed best on the TempEval
2013 test set. See the paper for more details:

Running TempEval 2013 experiments
=================================
To run experiments on the TempEval 2013 data:

1. Download the TempEval 2013 training data from
   http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task1/index.php?id=data
   under the "TBAQ-cleaned (NEW VERSION no self-relations)" link.

2. Extract the `TimeBank` and `AQUAINT` directories from the training data
   archive.

3. Download the annotated TempEval 2013 test data from
   http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task1/index.php?id=data
   under the "te3-platinumstandard.tar.gz" link.

4. Extract the `te3-platinum` directory from the annotated test data archive.

5. Delete the `README` file from the `te3-platinum` directory.

6. Run `org.cleartk.timeml.eval.TempEval2013Evaluation`. You will need to
   specify enough memory (e.g. `-mx1g` in your Java VM arguments) and the
   following program arguments:

       --train-dirs /path/to/TimeBank /path/to/AQUAINT
       --test-dirs /path/to/te3-platinum

   This will print some evaluation statistics to standard error, and will also
   write out .tml files to `target/tempeval2013/timeml`.

7. Download the TempEval 2013 scorer from
   http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task1/index.php?id=data
   under the "Download Evaluation Toolkit" link.

8. Extract the `tools` directory from the scorer archive. 

9. From the `tools` directory, run the scorer:

       python TE3-evaluation.py /path/to/te3-platinum /path/to/target/tempeval2013/timeml

Note that the parameters in step (6) roughly correspond to the TB+AQ model
reported in:

Steven Bethard. ClearTK-TimeML: A minimalist approach to TempEval 2013.
SemEval 2013. http://aclweb.org/anthology/S13-2002

The exact performance may have changed slightly due to changes in other parts
of ClearTK since the TempEval 2013 competition.

To explore models other than the TB+AQ model, `TempEval2013Evaluation` has a
variety of command line options which can be seen in the `Options` interface
at the top of the class. If you are exploring other settings, note especially
the `--tune` option, which will print out performance on a single task for a
variety of values of the hyperparameters of the classifier. (NOTE: You should
never `--tune` on the TempEval 2013 test data; use a cross-validation instead
by leaving off the `--test-dirs` option.) Once you have identified the best
hyperparameters, you will need to modify the `new Model.Params(...)`
creation in the `private static final Model` declaration for the model that you
`--tune`d.
