Model licensing issues
======================
The models in ClearTK-TimeML were trained on the TempEval 2013 data:

http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task1/index.php?id=data

The models do not contain the full original data, but they do contain features
and model information derived from this data. You should verify that it is
acceptable to your project to use models derived from such data (e.g. by
reading any license associated with the TempEval 2013 data and/or by consulting
a lawyer.) 
 

Training the TempEval 2013 models
=================================
The process for training models from the TempEval 2013 data is as follows:

1. Download the TempEval 2013 training data from
   http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/semeval-2013/task1/index.php?id=data
   under the "TBAQ-cleaned (NEW VERSION no self-relations)" link.

2. Extract the `TimeBank` directory from the training data archive.

3. Run `org.cleartk.timeml.eval.TempEval2013Evaluation`. You will need to
   specify enough memory (e.g. `-mx1g` in your Java VM arguments) and the
   following program arguments:

       --train-dirs /path/to/TimeBank
       --verb-clause-tlinks
       --train-only

   This will generate all the necessary ClearTK-TimeML models in the
   appropriate directories under `src/main/resources`.

Note that the above settings are those that performed best on the TempEval
2013 test set. See the paper for more details:
