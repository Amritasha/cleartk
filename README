3. Sample Texts / Gutenberg
###########################

The test code in ClearTK makes use of various texts.  These texts can be found in one of two places - the test/data directory or as String objects in the unit test code.  If not otherwise specified, the texts were written by a ClearTK author.  In many cases, we copied text from an e-book provided by the Gutenberg project.  These should be noted with pointers to the source of the text (where we copied it from) and a pointer to the Gutenberg License:

4. Compiling and running ClearTK with ant
#########################################
Before you compile ClearTK you should copy build.properties.example to 
build.properties and update the example property values with actual
values that apply to your environment.  ClearTK can be compiled with
the following command:

shell>ant compile

The test scripts can be compiled and run with the following commands

shell>ant compile-tests
shell>ant run-tests

Sometimes there are compile problems with the unit tests if they have been
modified between calls to 'compile-tests'. In such cases start with a clean
compilation of the entire ClearTK.  

shell>ant clean
shell>ant compile
shell>ant compile-tests
shell>ant run-tests

5. Unit tests
#############

For release 0.9 we had 194 test suites with 2367 assertions with a code coverage of 63.5% 
as measured by EclEmma.  Unfortunately, many of our unit tests were not distributed simply
because they rely on data (e.g. treebank .mrg files) which we cannot redistribute.  Many of our
tests made use of song lyrics which also shouldn't be redistributed.  We intend to fix these issues
for the 1.0 release by 1) removing unnecessary song lyrics and 2) providing instructions on how to
obtain files required by tests.
