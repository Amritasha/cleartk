{"name":"ClearTK","tagline":"Machine learning components for Apache UIMA","body":"ClearTK provides a framework for developing statistical natural language processing (NLP) components in Java and is built on top of Apache UIMA. It is developed by the [Center for Computational Language and Education Research (CLEAR)](http://clear.colorado.edu/) at the University of Colorado at Boulder.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* A common interface and wrappers for popular machine learning libraries such as [SVMlight](http://svmlight.joachims.org/), [LIBSVM](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/), [LIBLINEAR](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/), [OpenNLP MaxEnt](http://opennlp.apache.org/), and [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/).\r\n* A rich feature extraction library that can be used with any of the machine learning classifiers. Under the covers, ClearTK understands each of the native machine learning libraries and translates your features into a format appropriate to whatever model you're using.\r\n* Infrastructure for creating NLP components for specific tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, BIO-style chunking, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, temporal relation tagging, etc.\r\n* Wrappers for common NLP tools such as the Snowball stemmer, the OpenNLP tools, the MaltParser dependency parser, and the Stanford CoreNLP tools.\r\n* Corpus readers for collections like the Penn Treebank, ACE 2005, CoNLL 2003, Genia, TimeBank and TempEval.\r\n\r\n## User Documentation\r\nThe following resources are intended for people who want to use ClearTK in their own projects:\r\n* [ClearTK 2.0.0 API](http://bethard.github.io/cleartk/apidocs/2.0.0/) - API documentation (Javadoc) for the latest release.  \r\n* [1.4.1 API](http://bethard.github.io/cleartk/apidocs/1.4.1/) - API documentation (Javadoc) for the previous release.  \r\nIf you have more questions about using ClearTK, please post them to [cleartk-users@googlegroups.com](mailto:cleartk-users@googlegroups.com).\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMost of ClearTK is distributed under [the BSD license here](http://cleartk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cleartk-release/LICENSE).  However, there are a couple of sub-projects that are licensed under the GPL license because they depend on GPL licensed third party libraries.  In order to comply with the GPL we have isolated the code that has GPL dependencies into sub-projects which are licensed with GPL and these projects are excluded from our main release on our downloads page.
