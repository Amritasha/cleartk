This sub-project of ClearTK, cleartk-stanford-corenlp, provides a UIMA wrapper for
the Stanford CoreNLP tools (http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml).


== Dependencies ==

Stanford CoreNLP is not available via maven, so currently you must download it
yourself and specify the location of the jars via properties, e.g.:

   -Dedu.stanford.corenlp=stanford-corenlp-2010-11-12.jar
   -Dedu.stanford.corenlp.models=stanford-corenlp-models-2010-11-06.jar


== Licensing ==

In order to comply with the license used by Stanford CoreNLP, GPL v2.0, this project
is also provided under the terms of the GPL v2.0 license.  This project should be
considered as a separate project from the rest of ClearTK and should not be distributed
with the rest of ClearTK.  If you have a project that depends or makes use of
cleartk-stanford-corenlp, then you should be aware that the GPL license is quite
different than the BSD-style license used throughout most of the rest of ClearTK.  As
such, compliance with the GPL license may be significantly different and may require
you to release your software under the same license if you redistribute the software.
This notice is not intended as legal advice but rather to bring your attention to the
different license used here.  Please seek legal advice as required by your situation.
