This is the tree kernel svmlight adapter for cleartk. It works with
Alessandro Moschitti tree kernel version of svmlight. That can be
found here: http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/Tree-Kernel.htm

Unforunately, when you you compile the tree kernel version of svm light,
it creates two executables named svm_learn and svm_classify. These
are the same executable names which the normal svmlight creates. Since
you can only reference one of these executables (whichever comes first
in the PATH variable) at a time, the adapter expects you to create a
soft link to the tree kernel versions.

% ln -s <tk_bin_path>/svm_learn <bin_path>/tk_svm_learn
% ln -s <tk_bin_path>/svm_classify <bin_path>/tk_svm_classify

Where <bin_path> is a path found in your PATH environment variable.

This seemed the easiest way for both the tree kernel svmlight and the
original svmlight to coexist (without unnecessary pom configuration
needing to be done).
